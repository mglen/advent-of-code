# advent-of-code

See: http://adventofcode.com/

2017 is my first year doing advent of code in earnest. To keep myself going, I competed on a private leaderboard with a group of friends and coworkers.

All answers done in Python, some done additionally in other languages. Code has been cleaned up for most, but not all days. Some anwers were tuned for quicker runtime, others tidied up for clarity.

Days [3](2017/day03) [7](2017/day07) [18](2017/day18) [21](2017/day21) [23](2017/day23) were among the hardest for me, with day 23 deserving its own readme file.
